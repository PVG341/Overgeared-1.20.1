Fletching Table idea
You have to use the fletching table to craft arrows but you can also use it to make tipped arrows directly
You can now also make tipped arrows by having a potion in your offhand and right click with an arrow in your main hand
But you can only make 1 arrow at a time by doing this
Each potion can tip a max of 8 arrows (temporary numbers, I'll look into mods that add cauldron tipping to see how many arrow can be made using that functions)
The potion that was used for tipping will have the potion duration reduced based on the remaining amount in the bottle
You can also change the tips of the arrows in the fletching table
So for example you have too much flint tips you can still change it to iron or steel tips
